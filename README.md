# Guide-Dog-Training-Outcome-Prediction
* Built a logistic regression model that predicted the training outcome for a given guide dog data and trainer data.  * This project helps to determine the key features that can increase the dog training success rates and also helps to match the right dog with the right trainer. * Worked on Recursive Feature Elimination to analyze and rank the features. * Implemented normalization and feature extraction using TF-IDF, Word2Vec and CountVectorizer algorithms  * Improve the accuracy of the model by 30% . * For more details on Guide Dog Prediction: https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/07/watson-guiding-eyes/ Technologies: Scala (spark), Python (Jupyter notebooks included)
